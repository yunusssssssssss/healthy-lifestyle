               Good sleep habits, also known as sleep hygiene, are essential for maintaining physical and mental health. Proper sleep helps improve mood, cognitive function, and overall well-being. Here’s a comprehensive guide to developing healthy sleep habits:

               1. Consistent Sleep Schedule
               Regular Bedtime and Wake Time: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body’s internal clock.
               Sleep Duration: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night for adults. Children and teenagers need more sleep depending on their age.
               2. Creating a Restful Environment
               Comfortable Mattress and Pillows: Ensure your bed is comfortable and supportive.
               Cool, Dark, and Quiet Room: Keep your bedroom cool (around 60-67°F or 15-19°C), dark, and quiet. Use blackout curtains, earplugs, or white noise machines if needed.
               Limit Screen Exposure: Avoid screens (TV, phones, tablets) at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light can interfere with melatonin production.
          </p>


          <p>3. Pre-Sleep Routine
               Relaxation Techniques: Engage in calming activities before bed, such as reading, taking a warm bath, or practicing relaxation exercises like deep breathing, meditation, or gentle yoga.
               Avoid Stimulants: Refrain from consuming caffeine, nicotine, and heavy meals close to bedtime. Alcohol can also disrupt sleep patterns.
               4. Daytime Habits
               Physical Activity: Regular exercise can promote better sleep, but avoid vigorous activity close to bedtime.
               Exposure to Natural Light: Spend time outdoors or get exposure to natural light during the day to help regulate your sleep-wake cycle.
               5. Manage Stress and Anxiety
               Mindfulness and Meditation: Practices like mindfulness and meditation can help reduce stress and promote better sleep.
               Journaling: Writing down worries or a to-do list before bed can help clear your mind.
               6. Avoid Napping
               Limit Naps: If you need to nap, limit it to 20-30 minutes and avoid napping late in the day, as it can interfere with nighttime sleep.
               7. Healthy Diet
               Balanced Diet: Eating a healthy diet can improve sleep. Avoid heavy, rich foods, especially in the evening.
               Hydration: Drink enough water throughout the day but reduce fluid intake before bedtime to avoid waking up at night.
